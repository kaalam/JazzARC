	A Core is the unit of execution. It has a stack, initialized on construction and a Code object to be executed.
	A Core is an iterator executing one function call per iteration.
	Each iteration returns the last block pushed to the stack (without poping it).

	A complete execution of a Code snippet looks like:

	`core = Core(code, state_of_the_stack)`
	`*_, last_block = core`
	`if core.all_right:`
	`	do_something_with(last_block)`

	The stack argument (is empty by default) is a list of Block objects pushed to the stack (LIFO) before execution.
